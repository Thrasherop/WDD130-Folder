## Purpose

This file documents my learning journey in BYU-Idahos WDD130 class.

A note on code quality
This repository is not represantative of my current skills. I built it in college for assignments. It was built and duct taped together only as needed. In more complex or longer term projects, I would actually write good code. This is not good code, and it was never intended to be.
