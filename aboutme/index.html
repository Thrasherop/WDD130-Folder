        <h2>Joshua</h2>
        <p> I am a junior Brigham Young University-Idaho and I'm studying Software Engineering with a specialty in Embedded Systems. My hobbies include video games and recreational coding, as well as rock climbing. I enjoy tinkering with technology, and I've spent a good amount of time tinkering with old toys and old desktop PC's.  </p>
        <p>I'm a proud member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and I have been my entire life. Christ is an incredibly important part of my life, and I am extremely grateful for him.</p>
        <p> Once I graduate I hope to gain a job at NASA. All my life I've greatly enjoyed science and learning. Recently I've gained a great appreciation for knowledge, and I wish to be able to collect more. Thus, I wish to work for NASA programming probes and instruments to fuel the next generation of scientific discovery. This is a very high demand job, but I hope I can get it!</p>
